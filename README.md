Developed a Machine Learning model in Python to predict housing prices based on multiple factors such as area, location, number of rooms, and amenities.

Performed Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical features).

Applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn to identify key price-driving features.

Implemented Linear Regression & Random Forest models to compare performance.

Optimized the model using feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning, achieving improved accuracy.

Visualized price trends and insights using Seaborn heatmaps and Matplotlib charts.
